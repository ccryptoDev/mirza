    <h3>A Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act</h3>

    <p>
      The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) promotes the accuracy,
      fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting
      agencies. There are many types of consumer reporting agencies, including
      credit bureaus and specialty agencies (such as agencies that sell
      information about check writing histories, medical records, and rental
      history records). Here is a summary of your major rights under the FCRA.
      <strong>
        For more information, including information about additional rights, go
        to www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore or write to: Consumer Financial
        Protection Bureau, 1700 G Street N.W., Washington, DC 20552.
      </strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      &bull;
      <strong>
        You must be told if information in your file has been used against you.
      </strong>
      Anyone who uses a credit report or another type of consumer report to deny
      your application for credit, insurance, or employment – or to take another
      adverse action against you – must tell you, and must give you the name,
      address, and phone number of the agency that provided the information.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0">
      &bull;
      <strong>You have the right to know what is in your file.</strong>
      You may request and obtain all the information about you in the files of a
      consumer reporting agency (your “file disclosure”). You will be required
      to provide proper identification, which may include your Social Security
      number. In many cases, the disclosure will be free. You are entitled to a
      free file disclosure if:
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 0">
      &bull; a person has taken adverse action against you because of
      information in your credit report;
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 0">
      &bull; you are the victim of identity theft and place a fraud alert in
      your file;
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 0">
      &bull; your file contains inaccurate information as a result of fraud;
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 0">&bull; you are on public assistance;</p>
    <p style="margin: 0">
      &bull; you are unemployed but expect to apply for employment within 60
      days.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, all consumers are entitled to one free disclosure every 12
      months upon request from each nationwide credit bureau and from nationwide
      specialty consumer reporting agencies. See
      <a
        href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer"
      >
        www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore
      </a>
      for additional information.
    </p>

    <p>
      &bull;
      <strong>You have the right to ask for a credit score.</strong>
      Credit scores are numerical summaries of your credit-worthiness based on
      information from credit bureaus. You may request a credit score from
      consumer reporting agencies that create scores or distribute scores used
      in residential real property loans, but you will have to pay for it. In
      some mortgage transactions, you will receive credit score information for
      free from the mortgage lender.
    </p>

    <p>
      &bull;
      <strong>
        You have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information.
      </strong>
      If you identify information in your file that is incomplete or inaccurate,
      and report it to the consumer reporting agency, the agency must
      investigate unless your dispute is frivolous. See
      <a
        href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer"
      >
        www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore
      </a>
      for an explanation of dispute procedures.
    </p>

    <p>
      &bull;
      <strong>
        Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate,
        incomplete, or unverifiable information.
      </strong>
      Inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information must be removed or
      corrected, usually within 30 days. However, a consumer reporting agency
      may continue to report information it has verified as accurate.
    </p>

    <p>
      &bull;
      <strong>
        Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative
        information.
      </strong>
      In most cases, a consumer reporting agency may not report negative
      information that is more than seven years old, or bankruptcies that are
      more than 10 years old.
    </p>

    <p>
      &bull; <strong>Access to your file is limited.</strong> A consumer
      reporting agency may provide information about you only to people with a
      valid need -- usually to consider an application with a creditor, insurer,
      employer, landlord, or other business. The FCRA specifies those with a
      valid need for access.
    </p>

    <p>
      &bull;
      <strong>
        You must give your consent for reports to be provided to employers.
      </strong>
      A consumer reporting agency may not give out information about you to your
      employer, or a potential employer, without your written consent given to
      the employer. Written consent generally is not required in the trucking
      industry. For more information, go to

      </a>
      .
    </p>

    <p>
      &bull;
      <strong>
        You may limit “prescreened” offers of credit and insurance you get based
        on information in your credit report.
      </strong>
      Unsolicited “prescreened” offers for credit and insurance must include a
      toll-free phone number you can call if you choose to remove your name and
      address from the lists these offers are based on. You may opt out with the
      nationwide credit bureaus at 1-888-5-OPTOUT (1-888-567-8688).
    </p>

    <p>
      &bull; <strong>You may seek damages from violators.</strong> If a consumer
      reporting agency, or, in some cases, a user of consumer reports or a
      furnisher of information to a consumer reporting agency violates the FCRA,
      you may be able to sue in state or federal court.
    </p>

    <p>
      &bull;
      <strong>
        Identity theft victims and active duty military personnel have
        additional rights.

      <strong>
        States may enforce the FCRA, and many states have their own consumer
        reporting laws. In some cases, you may have more rights under state law.
        For more information, contact your state or local consumer protection
        agency or your state Attorney General. For information about your
        federal rights, contact:
